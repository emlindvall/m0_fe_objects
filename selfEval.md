# Self Evaluation

1. What did you struggle with in this section?
* Again, self-learning can be tricky, but I enjoyed this. There was a minute where I did not understand what was being asked of me when given the prompt "print the object to console" but I got there eventually!
2. How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
* I take the most helpful notes during lecture and during pairing sessions! I've been using a notes doc which I know is not ideal, but my handwriting is atrocious and I don't trust myself to be able to read things back later. Plus this way I can copy snippets of code into that space and have it live with the notes I need to reference it alongside.
3. What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
* I try to solve it on my own first, but when I get hung up a few times I'll definitely Google it. I think the act of looking away from Terminal or Replit is actually what's helpful there (it helps "unstick" my brain, I think), since it's usually not actually the Google results-- those are usually so far over my head they might as well be written in Sanskrit.
